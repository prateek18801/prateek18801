# <center>Hi there, I am Prateek</center>

Welcome to my GitHub profile, you're probably lost but I won't hold it against you. My name is Prateek, and I am a full stack web developer from India, but don't let that fancy title fool you. I just know how to make a computer do my bidding. This is the place where I make and break things.

I have experience working with a variety of languages and frameworks, but I won't bore you with the details, you can find that on my resume or just take my word for it.

I'm a master at ðŸ’€:
- JavaScript, or as I like to call it, the duct tape of the web
- Node.js, a technology that is basically magic to me
- Express.js, the real MVP of the back-end
- MongoDB, my favorite NoSQL solution, because SQL is too mainstream
- SQL, for when you need to be old school
- HTML/CSS, because who doesn't love nested divs?

I am always looking to learn new technologies and currently busy completing engineering along with consloing some javascript bugs.

On my profile, you can find several of my personal projects, as well as contributions to open-source projects. I take pride in my ability to write clean code, and I always strive to follow best practices, when I'm feeling up to it. In addition to my technical skills, I have a background in user experience and design.

If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about a project, feel free to drop me a message! Just don't expect me to be serious all the time I may return a promise but never a callback.
