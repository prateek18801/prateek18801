# Hi there, I am Prateek

Welcome to my GitHub profile, you're probably lost but I won't hold it against you. My name is Prateek, and I am a software developer from India. This is the place where I make and break things.

## Tech Stack

I am always looking to learn new technologies, my current favourites include

I take pride in my ability to write clean code, and I always strive to follow best practices. In addition to my technical skills, I have some background in UX design.
